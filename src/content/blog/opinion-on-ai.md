As AI continues to advance at an exponential rate, many are starting to question the future of programming jobs. With AI systems like [Devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin) showcasing the ability to pass job interviews, fix bugs, and even deploy applications independently, it's understandable why some programmers are feeling uncertain about their career prospects. In this blog post, I'll share my perspective on the matter as a software engineer and a user of AI language models.

## The Value of Learning Programming and Correlation with AI Development

When my friend asked me whether he should stop learning programming and switch to another field, my response was clear: ***learning programming is always worthwhile***, regardless of your career path. Even if you don't directly apply programming skills in your job, the problem-solving and systematic thinking you develop through coding are invaluable. Learning to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps is a skill that translates well beyond the realm of IT.

While AI has made significant strides in recent years, it's important to recognize that we have not yet achieved Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude are incredibly powerful tools, but they are not yet capable of fully replacing human programmers. The idea that AI will completely take over programming jobs in the near future is still rather *utopian*.

Interacting with AI models effectively requires a specific skill set. Prompt engineering, the art of crafting queries to elicit accurate and meaningful responses from AI, has emerged as a new field. To be a successful prompt engineer, one must have a solid understanding of IT concepts, even if they are not an advanced programmer. This highlights the continued importance of learning programming fundamentals.

## Adapting to the AI Revolution

Rather than resisting the progress of AI, I believe we should embrace it and learn to work alongside these powerful tools. As the saying goes, **"If you can't beat them, join them."** By understanding and harnessing the capabilities of AI, we can use it to further human progress and innovation.

In conclusion, while the rapid advancements in AI may seem daunting for programmers, I firmly believe that learning to code remains a valuable pursuit. The skills and thought processes you develop through programming extend far beyond the IT industry. Rather than fearing AI, we should strive to understand and utilize it to our advantage. As long as we continue to adapt and grow alongside these technologies, there will always be a place for human programmers in the ever-evolving landscape of IT.
